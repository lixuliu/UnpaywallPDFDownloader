Life cycle energy of AAC masonry infilled residential building in India,"Zade, N.P.; Sarkar, P.; Davis, R.","Embodied energy plays an important role in the choice of building materials and is directly related to the sustainability of the built environment. Although autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) masonry is gaining popularity in reinforced concrete (RC) framed buildings due to its various advantages, the issue of embodied energy of such buildings has not received adequate research attention. This paper evaluates the initial embodied energy of a typical AAC block masonry infilled RC framed building and compares it with that of an identical building infilled with traditional fired clay brick masonry. The results show that using AAC block masonry instead of fired clay brick masonry reduces material flow and the material embodied energy of the building by 13% and 18%, respectively. In addition, it also evaluates the life cycle energy of the selected building with AAC block masonry infill using the life cycle assessment method. The calculated life cycle energy of the AAC block masonry infilled RC framed buildings contributes to the knowledge database. This study concludes that the use of AAC block masonry instead of fired clay brick masonry in RC framed buildings increases the sustainability of the built environment. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2024,,Energy Effic.,17,1,,,10.1007/s12053-024-10188-y,,#1,Zade 2024,,
Parametric Modeling of Flexural Response of Sandwich Composites,"Pleesudjai, C.; Mobasher, B.","The mechanical response of textile-reinforced aerated concrete sandwich panels was modeled for flexural loading. The core material used in the sandwich composite consisted of plain autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) and fiber-reinforced aerated concrete (FRAC). The stress skins for the sandwich beams were made out of AR-glass (ARG) textiles embedded in a cementitious matrix. A constitutive material model comprised of a multi-linear tension model for the bottom stress skin and an elastic-perfectly plastic compression model for the top stress skin. The core was modeled using an elastic-perfectly plastic tension and compression model. A detailed parametric study was conducted to determine the effect of the model parameters on the flexural response of the sandwich composite. The model was further applied to simulate the experimental flexural data from the static tests on sandwich composite beams. Flexural strength, stiffness, and energy absorption capacity can be determined for both static loadings. It is observed that textile reinforcement at the tension and compression faces of the beam element results in a ductile behavior using multiple flexural cracking, leading to diagonal tension cracking in the core element. The distributed cracking mechanism in the sandwich composite significantly improves the flexural properties by 5–10 times when compared to the plain aerated concrete specimens which predominantly exhibit single flexural cracks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,RILEM Bookseries,39,,199-208,,10.1007/978-3-031-15805-6_21,,#2,Pleesudjai 2023,,
Strengthening of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) masonry wallettes with fabric reinforced cementitious matrix for in-plane shear and out-of-plane loads,"Gupta, A.; Meena, G.K.; Singhal, V.","Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) masonry is popularly used for the construction of infill and partition walls in the RC and steel-framed structures. However, past research highlighted that AAC masonry may exhibit poor performance during seismic events due to its low tensile capacity. In this study, the flexural and shear performance of AAC masonry was enhanced by using the fabric-reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM). This strengthening scheme was applied in two modes: direct mode using anchor and sandwich method using adhesive mortar. These strengthening schemes were different from each other in the method of placing of the fabric. The experimental results showed that the proposed strengthening methods could improve the strength and ductility of the masonry under shear and flexural loads. The test results showed comparable strengths for both types of strengthening methodologies and either of two methods of fabric application may be chosen for the strengthening of AAC masonry, depending on the availability of materials and ease in construction. Moreover, the outcome of the conducted tests were compared with the respective theoretical predictions estimated using available analytical models and equations. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers",2023,,Structures,51,,1869-1880,,10.1016/j.istruc.2023.03.099,,#3,Gupta 2023,,
Structure behavior of a fabricated shotcrete sandwich wall system under axial compression,"Zhang, S.; Xie, Q.","A new type of fabricated shotcrete sandwich wall system is proposed. The wall system consisted of steel mesh, foamed concrete blocks, reinforced concrete layers, and core column. The shotcrete has been adopts in structural layer. Steel mesh is placed in the concrete layer. Foam concrete blocks are filled between concrete layers with function of insulation. Core columns are arranged along the cross section of wall with spacing 600mm. Prefabricated rebar cage place in core column. The finite element software ABAQUS is used to calculate its compressive strength, and the calculation results are compared with the theoretical method of related code.

Simplified Model Study of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Masonry Flexible Connection Infilled Frames with Basalt Fiber Grating Strips,"Wang, X.; Xiong, L.; Wang, Z.","Infilled walls and frames typically employ closely spaced rigid connection, which, under seismic actions, can lead to adverse effects such as amplified seismic responses, overall torsion, and the formation of weak layers in the structure. Flexible connection isolating the infilled walls from the frames can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of rigid connections. In order to reduce the structural mass and seismic impacts, Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) masonry flexible connection infilled walls have been widely researched. However, most AAC masonry flexible connection infilled walls require complex process operations for AAC blocks, which is not conducive to practical applications in engineering. Therefore, an AAC flexible connection infilled wall with Basalt Fiber Grating (BFG) strips instead of steel bars, with simplified process operations, has been proposed. Existing finite element models for BFG strip-reinforced AAC masonry flexible connection infilled walls employ solid elements, which are difficult to apply to large-scale structural simulations; moreover, existing simplified models for flexible connection infilled walls cannot simulate out-of-plane loading. In this paper, based on homogenization methods, using simplified elements to simulate components, a simplified model for the BFG strip-reinforced AAC masonry flexible connection infilled frame is proposed. Utilizing this model, stress analyses under both in-plane and out-of-plane loading are conducted and compared with corresponding experimental results. The results indicate that the in-plane simplified model (ISM) fits well with the experimental results in terms of hysteresis curves, with similar relationships between stiffness degradation and strength attenuation. The displacement force curve of the out-of-plane simplified model (OSM) before reaching the peak load is in good agreement with the experimental results. The maximum plastic range of OSM is 5% smaller than the test results, and it can be considered that the plastic ranges of the two are comparable, manifesting the models’ capability to adequately manifest arching behavior. The simplified model enables simulation of out-of-plane loading and provides a new approach for modeling large-scale frame structures with flexible connection infilled wall. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Buildings,14,4,,,10.3390/buildings14041033,,#5,Wang 2024,,
Impact of sustainable design in the construction sector on climate change,"Ahmed, N.; Abdel-Hamid, M.; Abd El-Razik, M.M.; El-Dash, K.M.","The demand to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a must to address the problem of climate change. This paper aims to help the decision makers locally and internationally to reduce the building's CO2 emissions in the project design phase. The paper studies the indoor CO2 emissions of green and conventional building. The assessment of embodied carbon of a green building material has been studied. It was found that the reinforced concrete has the significant negative impact, as it represents 78% of the total embodied carbon emissions. On the other hand, the insulation materials represent (2%) of the total emissions. Heavyweight cast concrete and the autoclaved aerated concrete have been proposed as alternatives, it was found that they achieved 23% & 50% reduction in the total embodied carbon emissions respectively. It is recommended to use autoclaved aerated concrete component as environmental alternative to reinforced concrete. © 2020 THE AUTHORS",2021,,Ain Shams Eng.

Mechanical and durability properties of hybrid fiber reinforced foam concrete,"Raj, B.; Sathyan, D.; Madhavan, M.K.; Raj, A.","Foam concrete is a light-weight concrete which consists of cement, filler, water and foaming agent. Despite the many advantages of foam concrete, its main disadvantages are lower strength & shrinkage. Shrinkage can be reduced by the effective use of natural fibers while in order to increase strength, synthetic fibers have a vital role. The addition of an optimum hybrid combination of synthetic and natural fibers in foam concrete can enhance its strength and make it more durable. This paper describes the study of mechanical, durability and functional characteristics of hybrid fiber reinforced foam concrete (HFRFC). The cement to filler ratio used in this study is 1:1, with the sand being completely replaced with bottom ash. The targeted design densities of all the specimens were 1600 kg/m3. Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber and coir fiber with volume fraction 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5% were added. The hybrid combinations were designed such that to get total volume of fibers as 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5%. From the investigations, it is inferred that the optimum percentage of fibers to get the maximum strength is 0.3% for both PVA and coir. In hybrid combinations, the strength is satisfactory without much reduction. The durability properties increased for all hybrid combinations. Thus, the hybrid fibers can be a solution to improve strength, functional characteristics and durability of light-weight foam concrete. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Constr Build Mater,245,,,,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.118373,,#7,Raj 2020,,
Numerical verification of interaction between masonry with precast reinforced lintel made of AAC and reinforced concrete confining elements,"Drobiec, L.; Jasiński, R.; Mazur, W.; Rybraczyk, T.","This paper describes results of numerical analyses of reinforced lintels made of autoclaved aerated concrete built into unconfined walls and walls confined with reinforced concrete. The combination of the Menétrey-Willam elastic-plastic failure criterion (M-W-3) and the Rankine criterion was used for numerical analysis of masonry. The parameters were determined by laboratory tests. Rebars were modelled using the Huber-Mises-Hencky yield criterion. The numerical model included interface elements att the interface between masonry units, at interfaces between reinforced concrete and masonry, and at interfaces between elements of test stands with a model using the Coulomb-Mohr (C-M) criterion. The majority of parameters of interface elements were assumed from laboratory tests. Results of numerical analysis were compared with laboratory tests. Results of numerical analysis and experiments were compatible in the range of load-carrying capacity of models and the failure method. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,,Appl.

Experimental Analysis of Out-of-plane Behavior of Masonry Infill Walls Strengthened with Textile Reinforced Mortar and Wall Post in Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Frames,"Boukani, R.; Farzam, M.; Nezamisavojbolaghi, K.; Behravesh, A.","An experimental study was carried out to contribute to the rather limited data on the out-of-plane (OOP) behavior of masonry infills in reinforced concrete (RC) frames strengthened with the wall post and the textile-reinforced mortar (TRM). For this purpose, one unreinforced specimen served as the control, one specimen was reinforced with the wall post, and two specimens were reinforced with the TRM. They were fabricated and subjected to cyclic OOP loading until a drift ratio of 6%. Load and displacement values were recorded, and the research team discussed the failure mechanisms of the specimens. Results showed that the application of the wall post had the highest efficiency as it increased the load by about 3 times, while this value for TRM-strengthened walls was only 1.5. Strengthening modified the cracking, shifting it towards the middle parts of the wall, changing it from a brittle to a failure mode. Comparison of the envelope curves of specimens revealed significant improvements. The ultimate displacement and energy absorption capacity for the specimen reinforced with the post wall increased by 30% and 300% respectively. Similarly, for TRM-strengthened specimens, these values were 48% and 100%. © 2024, Budapest University of Technology and Economics. All rights reserved.",2024,,Period. Polytech. Civ.

Bond strength of autoclaved aerated concrete manufactured using partial replacement of flyash with fibers – A review,"Arun Kumar, M.; Prasanna, K.; Chinna Raj, C.; Parthiban, V.; Kulanthaivel, P.; Narasimman, S.; Naveen, V.","Autoclaved aerated concrete is widely attracted because of its excellent environmentally friendly characteristics and thermal insulation property. Autoclaved lightweight concrete (ALC), autoclaved cellular concrete (ACC), cellular concrete, autoclaved concrete, porous concrete, Ytong, hebel block, aircrete, and thermalite are some of the other names for AAC. AAC is a cent percent green construction material that has been used to construct the highest rated green structure. It consumes the least amount of energy and material per cubic meter of product, making it the most energy and resource efficient. Unlike brick manufacturing, which wastes valuable agricultural soil, AAC uses fly ash as the most beneficial answer to the country's fly-ash use problem. AAC's unrivalled strength-to-weight ratio, which is even higher than M150 concrete and greatly exceeds Indian building code standards, is achieved by a high-pressure steam-curing autoclaving process. In this article physical, mechanical and microstructural properties of AAC on replacing fly ash with various additives are studied. Comparison of properties for AAC manufactured using different additives were made and explained. AAC is a versatile building material. Fiber reinforced aerated concrete (FRAC) is a form of light weight aerated concrete which consist of internal reinforcement with small polymer fibers. Numerous materials such as basalt, rice husk, granite, graphite, zeolite, municipal solid waste, iron ore tailings, silica fume were used as fibers and incorporated (especially organic and industrial wastes) in manufacturing process of AAC. The mechanical (drying shrinkage), physical (compressive strength, flexural strength, thermal insulation, modulus of elasticity) and microstructural analysis (XRD, SEM) were done for different fiber incorporated AAC and results were studied an d compared. Above study indicates that all the properties depend on main factors such as condition during autoclaving process. Thus by the use of autoclaving, various industrial wastes, industrial byproducts and organic wastes are used in manufacturing AAC leads to reduction in wastes and widening the application of AAC. © 2022",2022,,Mater.

Comparison of different post-demolition autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) recycling options,"Volk, R.; Steins, J.J.; Stemmermann, P.; Schultmann, F.","Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is used as masonry blocks and prefabricated reinforced elements preferably in residential buildings. Due to its porous structure and mineral composition, it combines low thermal conductivity and fire resistance properties. Consequently, the popularity of AAC increases. However, due to significant AAC production volumes in many European countries since the 1960s and 1970s and given building lifetimes, strongly increasing post-demolition AAC waste volumes can be expected in the following decades. Recycling these post-demolition AAC wastes could protect primary resources and landfill capacities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But, recycling of post-demolition AAC is not yet established. The majority of the waste is landfilled even though landfill capacities have decreased and the legal framework conditions in Europe regarding a circular economy are becoming stricter. Therefore, new recycling options are needed. Current research approaches propose different open-loop recycling routes for post-demolition AAC, e.g. lightweight aggregate concrete, lightweight mortar, no-fines concrete, floor screed, animal bedding, oil- and chemical binders, and insulating fills for voids and interstitial spaces. Additionally, closed-loop recycling is possible and under research. Finely ground post-demolition AAC powder can be directly used in AAC production or can be chemically converted to belite (C2S) clinker to substitute primary cement in AAC production. These promising recycling options are compared regarding environmental and economic aspects. We find that the resource consumption is lower in all recycling options since post-demolition AAC helps to save primary resources. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions associated with the substituted primary resources are saved - especially when substituting primary cement in closed-loop recycling. In economic terms, increasing landfill costs could be avoided, which leaves a considerable margin for the cost of pre-processing, transport and recycling. The results can help decision-makers to implement circular management for AAC by fostering post-demolition AAC recycling and reducing its landfilling. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Preparation and performance of autoclaved aerated concrete reinforced by dopamine-modified polyethylene terephthalate waste fibers,"Huang, F.; Zhang, J.; Zheng, X.; Wu, Y.; Fu, T.; Easa, S.; Liu, W.; Qiu, R.","The low tensile and flexural strengths make autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) susceptible to cracking and damage during transportation and service. This study investigated the use of waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber as AAC reinforcement, which is a byproduct from the textile industry. Meanwhile, waste granite powder from stone plate processing byproducts was used as a siliceous material in the preparation of fiber-reinforced AAC composites. The waste PET fibers were modified by dopamine hydrochloride to improve the interfacial adhesion between the fibers and the AAC matrix. Results showed that the AAC blocks with 0.1 wt% PET fiber (1 mm in length and 18 μm in diameter) increased the compressive and flexural strengths by 6.0 % and 28.4 %, respectively. By adding 2 g/L dopamine-modified waste PET fiber, the compressive and flexural strengths of the blocks were further increased by 12.7 % and 37.2 %, respectively. The PET fibers were characterized using water contact angle test, SEM, FTIR, XPS, and TG analyses. It was confirmed that the amino and hydroxyl groups were grafted onto the modified fiber surface, leading to improved hydrophilicity and reactivity of the fibers and thus enhanced interfacial bonding between the fibers and the AAC matrix. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Constr Build Mater,348,,,,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.128649,,#13,Huang 2022,,
Analysis of lightweight composite sections with reinforced concrete infill with autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC),"Okasha, M.A.T.A.; Abdel Razek, M.; El-Esnawi, H.; Alkhatib, S.","The development of composite sections is of great importance in structural design, with the aim of reducing weight and deflection while limiting the effect on the composite section’s strength and durability. This paper examines the computational analysis of composite sections where reinforced concrete was replaced with autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) in the compression zone. The first principles of concrete combined with Hook’s law were adopted to find a flexure, shear, equivalent modulus of elasticity, effective moment of inertia, and deflection. The results are discussed and investigated using the finite element models developed by ANSYS WORKBENCH software. We found that the proposed analytical model can effectively provide a solution for the composite cross-section. The comparison between the theoretical calculation of the first cracking loads and the finite element percentage ranges from 89 to 110%. The ratio of the computational calculation of the modulus of elasticity to the finite element results ranged from 0.91 to 1.06. The comparison between the theoretical calculation of the effective moment of inertia to the finite element percentage ranged from 92% to 118%.

Analysis of confined AAC walls under monotonic compression,"Drobiec, Ł.; Mazur, W.; Rybarczyk, T.","Confined walls are structures frequently encountered in seismic zones. They have been put to numerous tests over time, including entire buildings being tested under cyclic loading. However, the observed trend is that confined masonry structures are also built in areas of little or no seismic activity. The draft 2nd edition of Eurocode 6 even brings about calculation procedures for confined walls erected outside active seismic regions. That said, an insufficient number of tests have still been performed on confined masonry structures under monotonic load, a situation which has a considerable negative impact on the verification process regarding standard recommendations. This paper presents results obtained from tests carried out on 20 walls, both non-confined and with reinforced concrete confinement. The full-scale walls put to tests were built of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC). They were subjected to one loading cycle until failure. The testing procedure involved numerical simulations and calculations based on data obtained from the strut-and-tie models, as well as calculations carried out in accordance with the procedures laid down in the draft 2nd edition of Eurocode 6. It was demonstrated during the tests that wall confinement has a significant impact on the masonry resistance under monotonic load. The numerical models were used to determine the distribution of stresses in the test walls and to select the effective strut-and-tie model. The authors of the paper also verified the standard recommendations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Eng. Struct.,253,,,,10.1016/j.engstruct.2021.113756,,#15,Drobiec 2022,,
Fibre-reinforced foamed concretes: A review,"Amran, M.; Fediuk, R.; Vatin, N.; Lee, Y.H.; Murali, G.; Ozbakkaloglu, T.; Klyuev, S.; Alabduljabber, H.","Foamed concrete (FC) is a high-quality building material with densities from 300 to 1850 kg/m3, which can have potential use in civil engineering, both as insulation from heat and sound, and for load-bearing structures. However, due to the nature of the cement material and its high porosity, FC is very weak in withstanding tensile loads; therefore, it often cracks in a plastic state, during shrinkage while drying, and also in a solid state. This paper is the first comprehensive review of the use of man-made and natural fibres to produce fibre-reinforced foamed concrete (FRFC). For this purpose, various foaming agents, fibres and other components that can serve as a basis for FRFC are reviewed and discussed in detail. Several factors have been found to affect the mechanical properties of FRFC, namely: fresh and hardened densities, particle size distribution, percentage of pozzolanic material used and volume of chemical foam agent. It was found that the rheological properties of the FRFC mix are influenced by the properties of both fibres and foam; therefore, it is necessary to apply an additional dosage of a foam agent to enhance the adhesion and cohesion between the foam agent and the cementitious filler in comparison with materials without fibres. Various types of fibres allow the reduction of by autogenous shrinkage a factor of 1.2–1.8 and drying shrinkage by a factor of 1.3–1.8. Incorporation of fibres leads to only a slight increase in the compressive strength of foamed concrete; however, it can significantly improve the flexural strength (up to 4 times), tensile strength (up to 3 times) and impact strength (up to 6 times). At the same time, the addition of fibres leads to practically no change in the heat and sound insulation characteristics of foamed concrete and this is basically depended on the type of fibres used such as Nylon and aramid fibres. Thus, FRFC having the presented set of properties has applications in various areas of construction, both in the construction of load-bearing and enclosing structures. © 2020 by the authors.

"Alternative stabilised rammed earth materials incorporating recycled waste and industrial by-products: A study of mechanical properties, flexure and bond strength","Meek, A.H.; Elchalakani, M.; Beckett, C.T.S.; Dong, M.","Developing low-embodied energy building materials can significantly contribute to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. However, these new building materials must be properly understood before they can or will be adopted by the construction industry. Rammed earth materials with low greenhouse gas emissions have been developed based on the principles of alkali-activated stabilisation as replacements for conventional construction materials. In previous work by the authors, the strength development, durability and sustainability, via life cycle assessment, of these new materials have already been studied. However, how these materials interact with and affect embedded reinforcement is poorly understood, as are methods to test these properties. Their applicability in modern construction is therefore currently limited. This paper extends the understanding of these materials through flexural and push-out testing of specimens reinforced with steel and glass-fibre reinforced polymer bars. We determine mechanical properties of the alternatively-stabilised rammed earth materials and study the composite behaviour of the reinforced materials. The suitability of current testing standards for elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and indirect tensile, bond, shear and flexural strengths, originally designed for concrete specimens, were evaluated for RE materials. These were compared with design rules and predictions made using concrete standard AS 3600 and rammed earth standards (NZS 4297-4299), handbook (HB 195) and rammed earth and concrete literature. Results showed that existing testing procedures specified for concrete specimens were appropriate for estimating Poisson's ratio and shear modulus as well as for determining flexural and shear strengths for rammed earth. Existing rammed earth recommendations given in NZS 4297 for estimating elastic modulus should continue to be followed. An alternative compressive reinforcement bond test, similar to RILEM AAC 8.2 push-out standard for autoclaved aerated concrete, was proposed; however, more work is required to establish a better prediction model for bond strength. Results indicated that current expressions to relate indirect tensile to unconfined compressive strength are suitable for compressive strengths up to 20 MPa. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Constr Build Mater,277,,,,10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.122303,,#17,Meek 2021,,
Mechanical and physical properties of autoclaved aerated concrete reinforced using carbon fibre of different lengths,"Demir, I.; Sevim, O.; Ogdu, M.K.; Dogan, O.; Demir, S.","In this study, series of tests have been conducted to indicate the mechanical and physical properties (compressive strength, flexural strength, dry density, thermal conductivity and shrinkage) of autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) reinforced with carbon fibres of different lengths. AG2/350 AAC block specimens without carbon fibre were prepared as a control specimen. The mixtures were prepared by replacing 0.5% weight of cement in the AAC with 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm length carbon fibres and these mixtures were poured into moulds and subjected to 58 °C for 4 hours to expand until reaching workable hardness. After preliminary curing, the produced AAC specimens were subjected to 180 °C and pressure of 11 bar for 6 hours in a steam cure until required hardness. The mechanical and physical properties of the reference and the fibre reinforced AAC specimens were determined and compared to each other. As a result, the use of 12 mm fibre reinforcement in AAC gave the best performance in comparison to the other fibre reinforcements of different lengths by increasing compressive strength for 10.63%, flexural strength of 31.48% and thermal conductivity up to 4.23% while reducing the shrinkage ratio to 51.47%.

Experimental and analytical study on structural performance of reinforced lightweight geopolymer composites panels,"Li, Z.; Chen, W.; Hao, H.; Xu, C.; Pham, T.M.","Various lightweight panels such as autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) panels have been widely used in the prefabricated construction. With the growing demand for eco-friendly building materials, geopolymer as cementitious material has been extensively studied. A novel ambient-cured lightweight geopolymer composite (LGC) with expanded polystyrene (EPS) was recently developed by the authors and demonstrated sound static and dynamic mechanical properties. In this study, a new lightweight reinforced panel made of LGC is proposed for prefabricated structures. Five full-scale panels, including one AAC panel and four LGC panels with different configurations, were prepared and tested under four-point bending to investigate the effects of panel thickness and reinforcement configuration on the structural performance. The test results showed that the LGC panels demonstrated better structural performance, with the characteristic ultimate bending capacity 57%-110% higher than that of the corresponding AAC panel.

"Investigating the behavior of lightweight foamed concrete T-beams under torsion, shear, and flexure","Deifalla, A.; Awad, A.; Seleem, H.; Abdelrahman, A.","Compared to conventional normal weight concrete, Lightweight Concrete (LWC) has significantly lower own-weight-to-strength ratio and good thermal insulation. Previous studies showed that the design codes underestimate the strength of LWC beams under pure shear force or pure torsion moment. In addition, the behavior and design of LWC T-beams under combined bending, shear and torsion was never investigated. Thus, this current study explores the effect of various parameters on the behavior of lightweight foamed concrete (LWFC) T-beams under combined shear, torsion and moment. Investigated parameters included the following: shear-span-to-depth ratio, torsion-to-shear-depth ratio, flange-to-web-width ratio, and transversal reinforcement ratio. An experimental program was conducted which included testing five T-beams under various ratios of combined loading. In addition, a numerical model was developed for LWFC T-beams under combined loading and verified using available experimental results. Moreover, a parametric study was performed to further investigate the effect of the selected parameters on the behavior of LWFC T-beams. Last but not least, the most recent internationally recognized design code is selected and used to calculate the T-beams strength, which was compared with the ones from the experimental and numerical investigations. For small values of the shear-span-to-depth ratio, the LWFC T-beams strength increased with the decrease of the torsion-to-shear-depth ratio compared to those with large values of the shear-span-to-depth ratio. In addition, the effect of the flange width was found to be insignificant. Moreover, the failure mode for beams with transversal reinforcement ratio above 1.2%, changed from under-reinforced mode to an over-reinforced one. Last but not least, the strength predicted using selected design code was found to be overly conservative compared to that experimentally measured and that numerically predicted for LWFC T-beams under combined loading. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Eng.
